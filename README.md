Tips:

Code

 - At the bottom of this page is the code used in the example video.  It has a little bonus code that turns an unordered list into a horizontal navigation bar.

 - Feel free to use this a template for your project, or use your own code.

Images

 - Use placeholder images OR royalty free images from https://unsplash.com/

Centering content

 - Add this CSS to the <body> element, it will center your content on large screens:

width: 1000px; margin:auto;
That's it!
